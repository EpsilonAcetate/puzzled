Documentation? What's that? I only read the course notes. Anyway, here's some help with command syntax.

Note: Remove brackets when actually typing in commands.

`!status` -- get links for all the puzzles, see which puzzles you have solved / have left, see how many hints you have / have used
`!hint [puzzle name with no spaces] [description of what you've done so far & what you're stuck on]` -- get a hint on a puzzle
`!leaderboard` or `!lb` -- shows the leaderboard
`!guess [puzzle name with no spaces] [answer]` -- submit an answer for a puzzle

-- admin:
!register_team [name:`team name`] [list of pings of members of team]
!add_hints n -- make sure n>0!
!reset -- resets the state (i.e. deletes all teams, etc.)
!pause name:`team name` -- prevents that team from guessing
!unpause name:`team name` -- allows a paused team to guess again
!sudo -- allows you to directly do sql, be careful
