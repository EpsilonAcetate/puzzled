!hint [puzzle name] [description of what youve done]
!leaderboard or !lb
!guess [puzzle name] [answer]

-- admin:
!register_team [name:`team name`] [list of pings of members of team]
!add_hints n (will literally parse it, e.g. if negative itll deduct hints etc. be careful)
!reset -- deletes all teams etc i.e. resets the state
!pause name:`team name` -- prevents that team from guessing
!unpause name:`team name` -- unpauses
!sudo -- allows you to directly do sql. be careful
